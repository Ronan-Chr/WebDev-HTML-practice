            <h3>Where it all Started</h3>
            <p>Linkin Park is a iconic band in the rock genre known for unique vocals and heavy sounding instruments the band started when Mike Shinoda, Rob Bourdon and Brad Delson decided that they would start a band in California. The band over the next years created their first album but also were set on making a career out of things which is when they turned to record labels eventually signing a deal with Warner Bros. Records with the help of a mentor they had met named Jeff Blue who had recently taken over operations at Warner Bros Records.</p>

      <section id="members_section">
      <p>Linkin Park gained popularity from the unique noises added to their rock music for the time period having very good foundations from the intstruments and then working their way up in popularity with the use of high and low pitched screams and elongated words which was relativly new for the time which helped create the cultlike fan base they have had for years to come.</p>
