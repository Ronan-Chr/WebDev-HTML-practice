    <p>My favorite band as of recent is Linkin Park and im gonna dive into who they were and some things they did which made music history. An iconic band from the 90s and to this day exsists although new members in the current bands rendition. The band is a prime example of a passion project gone right most of the band were friendss who enjoyed music in their youth and have since then continued the band making a distography with over 100 songs through the years providing a life long luxiourious living for its members.</p>
